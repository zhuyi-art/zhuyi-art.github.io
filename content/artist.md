### Biography

Yi Zhu is an artist who grew up amid China's major social transformations, and he maintains a constantly evolving mindset. He has witnessed the dramatic changes in China's economic structure and the era of profound shifts, which have shaped his worldview.

In his early years, he engaged in printmaking and illustration, creating numerous works with unique visual compositions. During his career in commercial design, Yi Zhu led his own design company. The company provided designs for China's advertising market, promoted point-of-sale experiences, and handled packaging designs for international fast-moving consumer goods companies in the Chinese market. Under his leadership, the design company won the "Best Creative Award" and "Best Supplier Award" from the Chinese subsidiary of a well-known international brand.

Confronted with various social phenomena in the business sector and the struggles and aspirations of human nature amid competition, Yi Zhu has created a great number of prints and oil paintings, defining himself as a creator who deconstructs and reconstructs in painting. During the global pandemic in 2019, due to his insights into life, along with other factors, and having witnessed the ups and downs of life during the pandemic, he began to produce a large quantity of oil paintings and prints.

The underlying logic of life is breathing. Social factors endow this breathing with a stance, as well as the tension and contraction of life. This has ignited in Yi Zhu a strong desire to express such perceptions of life. Exhalation represents tension, while inhalation represents contraction. Life should not be suppressed; the essence of life is freedom.
