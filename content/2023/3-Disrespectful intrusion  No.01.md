### Description

Disrespectful intrusion

Distortion in culture is the perception of us regarding the disrespect of humanity toward nature. 

I have always thought the exploit of materiality is a way of abuse in humanity. In fact, species in nature is also exploiting humanity through ways of survival and occupation of our bodies.

The creations by artists are a disrespectful intrusion.

I absorb thoughts and feelings through the exploited in life for inspiration.

The pointing of the sharp objects can be symbolized as the immersion of creatures. The symbol of sharp objects can create a sense of intrusion in desire.

Color to me is an unspoken war. It intrudes, exploits, destroys and creates. Perhaps, it is not the world that is divided. It is the way of artists perceiving the world that is divided. Humanity and nature intrude disrespectfully into each other, and mutually control each other, which forms a culture distortion.

This culture distortion exists in the desires of humanity, and it exists in our divided yet integrated visuals.

In my world of deconstruction and reconstruction, the constructing basis of the visual language is the perception of the living desire. It is a revelation and a sublimation of spirituality from materiality.

Deconstruct materiality and reconstruct spirituality.

I perceive the world in my way to create this series of art works. I utilize lines, colors and pointing objects to create the mutual intrusion of desires, which resembles a dialogue between the soul and the thought in humanity.
