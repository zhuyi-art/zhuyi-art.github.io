### Description

Cement space

I feel the fragmentation and linearity of the modern city with layers of depth when I was in New York, Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai. This feeling is transformed into elements, with a pure special arrangement with structural gaps for growth and survival. Beyond the fragmentation boundary is the struggle for survival and freedom, revealing the purity of the mutual reliance for growth between human and species. We focus more on the space with concrete and the fragmentation from human behaviors. We are established and demolished with the same speed, while the species, which we ignore, are growing tenaciously in the rigid space with concrete.
