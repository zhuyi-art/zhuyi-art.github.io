### Description

Construct a state of mind.

We cherish the totem of life. We pass on life with heritage. In difficult times, we 
stay alive to seek beyond.

Yi Zhu is inspired by the totem and pottery culture of ancient China, along with 
the papercutting techniques in the Han Dynasty of China. He utilizes deconstruction 
and reconstruction to create a new relationship among colors, with the perception of
 expansion and contraction of life.

The creation of emotion from Yi Zhu is to awake the sense of life, empathy and love.

Our emotions are created because of the society, family, people, species and the 
disturbances of environment. Yi Zhu creates the subjective perception on the canvas 
with the objective perception outside of the canvas.

This is the spirit and style of Yi Zhu in creating a series of paintings of emotions.
